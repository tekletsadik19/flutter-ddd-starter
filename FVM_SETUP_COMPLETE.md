# ✅ FVM Setup Complete!

## 🎯 What's Been Configured

Your Flutter DDD Starter project is now fully configured for FVM (Flutter Version Management)!

### 📁 Files Added/Updated:

1. **`.fvmrc`** - Locks Flutter version to `stable`
2. **`.vscode/settings.json`** - Configures VS Code to use FVM Flutter SDK
3. **`setup_fvm.sh`** - Automated FVM setup script
4. **`test_migration.sh`** - Updated to use FVM commands
5. **`FVM_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Complete setup documentation
6. **`.gitignore`** - Updated to properly handle FVM files

### 🚀 Quick Start on Your Local Machine

Run this single command to set everything up:

```bash
./setup_fvm.sh
```

Or follow these manual steps:

```bash
# 1. Install FVM
brew tap leoafarias/fvm
brew install fvm

# 2. Set up Flutter version for project
fvm use stable

# 3. Get packages
fvm flutter packages get

# 4. Run build runner
fvm flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# 5. Test the Hive migration
fvm flutter test test/shared/infrastructure/security/hive_migration_test.dart
```

## 🔧 Daily Usage Commands

Use these FVM commands for all Flutter operations:

```bash
# Development
fvm flutter run                    # Run the app
fvm flutter test                   # Run tests
fvm flutter packages get           # Get dependencies

# Testing your Hive migration
./test_migration.sh                # Automated test script
fvm flutter test test/shared/infrastructure/security/hive_migration_test.dart

# Maintenance
fvm flutter clean                  # Clean build files
fvm flutter doctor                 # Check Flutter setup
```

## ✅ Benefits You'll Get

### 🔒 **Version Consistency**
- All team members use the same Flutter version
- No more "works on my machine" issues
- Consistent CI/CD builds

### 🚀 **Better Development**
- Switch between Flutter versions easily
- Test with different Flutter releases
- Isolated Flutter environments per project

### 🛠️ **Enhanced Workflow**
- VS Code automatically uses correct Flutter SDK
- Automated setup scripts
- Smart test scripts that detect FVM

## 🎯 Integration with Your Hive Migration

Your Hive migration with SHA-256 security is fully compatible with FVM:

```bash
# Test the migration
fvm flutter test test/shared/infrastructure/security/hive_migration_test.dart

# Run all tests
fvm flutter test

# Run the app with Hive caching
fvm flutter run
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Run the setup**: `./setup_fvm.sh`
2. **Restart VS Code**: To pick up new Flutter SDK path
3. **Test everything**: `./test_migration.sh`
4. **Start developing**: `fvm flutter run`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **VS Code not finding Flutter**: Restart VS Code after FVM setup
- **Commands not working**: Make sure you're using `fvm flutter` prefix
- **Version conflicts**: Run `fvm flutter clean` and reinstall packages

### Useful Commands:
```bash
fvm list                          # Show installed versions
fvm releases                      # Show available versions  
fvm use 3.19.0                   # Switch to specific version
fvm global stable                # Set global default
```

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your project now has:
- ✅ FVM for Flutter version management
- ✅ Hive caching with SHA-256 security
- ✅ Automated setup and test scripts
- ✅ VS Code integration
- ✅ Team-friendly configuration

Happy coding! 🚀
