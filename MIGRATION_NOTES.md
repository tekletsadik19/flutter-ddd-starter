# Hive Migration with SHA-256 Security

## Migration Summary

This migration replaces SharedPreferences with Hive database using SHA-256 encryption for enhanced security.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated
- **Removed**: `shared_preferences: ^2.3.3`
- **Added**: 
  - `hive: ^2.2.3`
  - `hive_flutter: ^1.1.0`
  - `crypto: ^3.0.3`
  - `hive_generator: ^2.0.1` (dev dependency)

### 2. Security Implementation
- Created `EncryptionService` with SHA-256 key derivation
- Created `HiveEncryptionManager` for managing encrypted Hive boxes
- All data is encrypted using AES with SHA-256 derived keys
- Added data integrity verification using SHA-256 hashing

### 3. Updated Components

#### Cache Manager (`lib/shared/infrastructure/caching/cache_manager.dart`)
- Replaced SharedPreferences with encrypted Hive box
- Maintains same interface for backward compatibility
- Uses `cache_box` with encryption cipher

#### Secure Storage (`lib/shared/infrastructure/security/secure_storage.dart`)
- Replaced SharedPreferences with highly encrypted Hive box
- Added SHA-256 data integrity verification
- Uses `secure_box` with enhanced security cipher
- Automatically removes corrupted data

#### Counter Local Data Source (`lib/features/counter/infrastructure/datasources/counter_local_data_source.dart`)
- Replaced SharedPreferences with encrypted Hive box
- Uses `counter_box` for counter data persistence
- Maintains same functionality with enhanced security

#### Dependency Injection (`lib/core/di/injection_container.dart`)
- Removed SharedPreferences initialization
- Added Hive initialization with `Hive.initFlutter()`
- Added HiveEncryptionManager registration

### 4. Security Features

#### Encryption
- **Key Derivation**: SHA-256 based key generation
- **Encryption Algorithm**: AES (via HiveAesCipher)
- **Key Management**: Separate keys for cache, secure storage, and counter data

#### Data Integrity
- SHA-256 hashing for data verification
- Automatic corruption detection and removal
- Timestamp tracking for audit trails

#### Box Configuration
- Separate encrypted boxes for different data types
- Configurable compaction strategies
- Secure random key generation option

## Next Steps

### Required Actions
1. **Run build_runner** to regenerate dependency injection:
   ```bash
   flutter packages get
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

2. **Test the migration**:
   - Verify all caching functionality works
   - Test secure storage operations
   - Ensure counter persistence works
   - Check data integrity verification

### Migration Benefits
- **Enhanced Security**: AES encryption with SHA-256 key derivation
- **Better Performance**: Hive is faster than SharedPreferences
- **Data Integrity**: Built-in corruption detection
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed data storage
- **Compression**: Automatic data compaction
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent behavior across platforms

### Box Structure
- `cache_box`: General application cache with TTL support
- `secure_box`: Highly secure storage for sensitive data
- `counter_box`: Counter-specific data persistence

### Security Considerations
- Keys are derived using SHA-256 from predefined passwords
- Each box type uses a different encryption key
- Data integrity is verified using SHA-256 hashing
- Corrupted data is automatically detected and removed
- All operations are logged for debugging

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, you can temporarily revert by:
1. Restoring `shared_preferences` dependency
2. Reverting the implementation files
3. Running build_runner to regenerate dependencies

However, data migration between storage systems may be needed.
